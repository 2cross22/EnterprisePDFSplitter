# PDF Document Processing System

A high-performance Python application for automated document processing and data extraction. This enterprise-grade tool processes large volumes of documents with parallel processing capabilities and comprehensive error handling.

## Features

- **Parallel Processing**: Multi-core processing for handling large document batches efficiently
- **Data Extraction**: Automated extraction of structured data from documents
- **Progress Tracking**: Resume capability for long-running operations
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management with detailed logging
- **CSV Export**: Structured data output for further analysis
- **Memory Efficient**: Optimized for processing large files without memory issues

## Technical Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- **PyPDF2**: PDF manipulation and page extraction
- **pdfplumber**: Advanced text extraction from PDFs
- **Pillow**: Image processing capabilities
- **Multiprocessing**: Parallel execution for performance
- **CSV/JSON**: Data serialization and export

## Installation

The application automatically installs required dependencies on first run:

```bash
python pdf_scanner_enterprise.py
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
python pdf_scanner_enterprise.py file1.pdf file2.pdf
```

### Advanced Options
```bash
# Process with custom worker count
python pdf_scanner_enterprise.py *.pdf --workers=8

# Resume interrupted processing
python pdf_scanner_enterprise.py *.pdf --resume
```

## Output

The system generates:
- **Individual processed files**: Organized in output directories
- **CSV report**: `pdf_processing_results.csv` with extracted metadata
- **Progress tracking**: `processing_progress.json` for resumable operations

## Performance
